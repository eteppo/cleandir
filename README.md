# cleandir
A short bash script for cleaning unorganized backups of images, videos, and other files.

IMPORTANT: ALWAYS HAVE A BACKUP BEFORE MAKING IRREVERSIBLE CHANGES.

Currently the script does the following tasks:

1. Flatten a directory
2. Remove empty directories
3. Remove exact duplicates (md5sum)
4. Organize files by file extension and last modification year
